Title: HMM for Partiall Observed Three Diagnostic Test Data 
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Functions for partially observed data HMM.  Data is composed of three diagnostic tests (i.e. HPV test, pap smear, and colposcopy).  
   Partially observed data is represented as all possibilities in a 3-dimensional array.  First data source must be a 3-d array.  Second and third data sourced 
   must be same size and have the same first 2-dimensions as the first data source.  We have adapted the forward-backward algorigthm to easily incorporate partially observed data. We run an EM algorithm where we estimate the initial probability vector, 
   transition matrix, classification matrix, and probability of being a stayer.
